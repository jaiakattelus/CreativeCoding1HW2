I know it's an early moment, but i really identified with the moment he had at Disneyland where he realizes he wanted a career in making what would later be called Virtual Reality.
I know all too well the feeling of discovering something i find incredible and wanting to learn the inner workings. I was always fascinated in how music was created so it was
only natural that i would eventually get my hands on some programsand start making things. That was more than ten years ago but I still have these habits. Just last winter I 
learned how to make volleyballs by cutting, hole punching, screen printing and sewing leather.
There are many messages from the lecture that stand out to me, but i really liked when he was talking about the masters degree students and the no book policy. The idea that
masters degree students should be immersing themselves in their work instead of reading more textbook material makes perfectsense to me.
