According to the, often grammatically incorrect, mindset quiz; i am a 45/60 which means i have a great growth mindest. That was very encouraging to me because even though i can 
pick up things quickly, accept and move on and problem solve, i still feel stuck from time to time. I have also gotten a little worse about reading instructions over the years.
If it's a long text i have to read, I'll start from the bottom and skim backwards, ill skip around looking for keywords or ill skim forward the regular way. All before opting to 
read the text like a normal human being. I have to learn how to do everything the hard way moving two steps forward then one step back. I think there are good learning style
guidlines but ultimately everyone learns new things in their own way through patterns learned over time.
